I struggled with browser history 1 quite a bit. While it was relatively easy to complete after watching the screencast, starting out was confusing. I would definitely recommend trying the browser history 1 on your own at first, regardless of if you don’t fully understand the steps yet. I would also advise you to fully delete the project after each attempt so you don’t feel that you have the option to fall back on old code.

My second attempt was much smoother because I finally figured out how to structure the page (I was originally having a hard time ordering the <li></li> tags, <H2></H2>  tags) and inserting images. The second attempt fit within the DNF time which was really my only goal. Unfortunately, I didn’t complete this WOD without referencing the screencast, which will definitely be a goal for future WODs.

Lastly, I received a pretty bad grade on my first attempts for WODs 1,2 and 3 because I left out the voice over. So, save yourself and your TA the time and make sure you do that the first time around.
