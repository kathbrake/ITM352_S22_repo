Browser history 2 was a simpler process in that creating stylesheets is a bit easier than index.html pages - in my personal opinion. I did reference the video as a refresher for the code used to link style.css in the index.html file, structuring the code for the font, and aligning the logos. I did this WOD twice to get a time that I was happy with. I overall felt more satisfied with this experience because I felt like I didn’t get stuck as frequently (though I did still struggle a bit with the sections I mentioned above.) If you are familiar with creating and embedding stylesheets into your html index, I think this one is definitely possible to do without referencing the videos. You may have to search things on google if you need a refresher.

Like the first WOD, I didn’t do a voice over the first time around so I would definitely advise everyone to do that so you don’t have to go back and fix it.
