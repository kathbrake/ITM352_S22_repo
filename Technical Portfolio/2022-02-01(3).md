The first time I did this WOD, it definitely took me awhile and I didn’t feel entirely certain about what I was doing. I believe it took me around 25 minutes before I decided to redo the whole thing. I did end up referencing the video for help with styling the section links in a horizontal bar, as I haven’t done this in awhile. This ended up helping a lot and the second time I ran through it was much efficient. Also, I also found that it helped to slow down and approach it in a more methodical and calm way. The first time I ran through this WOD, I was stressed about significantly going over the time limit and as a result I made more mistakes than I would’ve otherwise. It’s also important to remember that it’s alright to restart the WOD before finishing if you feel like it will help. I originally felt like I needed to fully complete this lab the first time around (despite being way over the DNF time) and ended up having a much smoother time completing it on the second attempt.
