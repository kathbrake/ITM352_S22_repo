Invoice 1 was likely the most difficult WOD we’ve completed so far. I understood the outline of the assignment and the instructions were clear, however, I struggled with creating variables with corresponding expressions and setting up the html with the correct syntax. I definitely relied on the screencast video more than I would like to admit and I know it doesn’t benefit me to do so. On the other hand, it’s hard to remember exactly what code to use because these are relatively new concepts. 

Like the instructions mentioned, I would highly recommend checking your work as you go as this WOD doesn’t take kindly to small errors - it’s much simpler to fix everything as you go.
